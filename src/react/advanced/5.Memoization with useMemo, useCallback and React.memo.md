# Memoization in React: Optimizing Component Re-Renders

## Introduction

Memoization is a powerful technique used to optimize the performance of React applications by preventing unnecessary
re-renders. React provides several tools for memoization: `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`. Each of these
tools plays a unique role in ensuring components and functions are only recalculated when necessary. Understanding how
and when to use them is crucial for building performant React applications.

---

## Understanding the Problem

When a component re-renders in React, it evaluates the values of its dependencies. However, certain dependencies, such
as functions and objects, can be re-created during each re-render, triggering unnecessary updates and performance
issues. React compares the old value with the new one to decide whether a re-render is needed.

### The Challenge with Recreated Functions

Consider the following example where a `submit` function is declared inside the component:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const submit = () => {
        // some action
    };
    useEffect(() => {
        submit();
    }, [submit]);
    return <button onClick={submit}>Submit</button>;
};
```

In this case, the `submit` function is recreated on each re-render, which results in the `useEffect` hook running every
time, even if the logic inside `submit` hasn't changed. React compares the old and new function references, and since
they are different each time, it triggers a re-render.

---

## Using `useMemo` and `useCallback` for Optimization

### `useCallback`

`useCallback` is used to memoize functions so that they retain the same reference between re-renders. By wrapping the
function inside `useCallback`, React will only recreate the function if the dependencies change.

Example:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const submit = useCallback(() => {
        // submit action
    }, []); // No dependencies, so it won't change between renders.

    useEffect(() => {
        submit(); // The same reference is passed, preventing unnecessary re-renders
    }, [submit]);

    return <button onClick={submit}>Submit</button>;
};
```

In this example, `submit` will maintain the same reference across re-renders, and `useEffect` won't unnecessarily run on
every re-render.

### `useMemo`

`useMemo` is similar to `useCallback`, but it memoizes the result of a computation instead of the function itself. If
you want to memoize an object or an expensive calculation, `useMemo` ensures the result remains stable between renders.

Example:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const data = useMemo(() => ({id: '1', name: 'React'}), []);
    return <div>{data.name}</div>;
};
```

Here, the object `data` is only recomputed if its dependencies change. Since the dependencies array is empty, the object
is memoized and doesn't change on each render.

---

## `React.memo`: Memoizing Components

### What is `React.memo`?

`React.memo` is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders of a component if its props havenâ€™t
changed. This is particularly useful for optimizing functional components that are passed the same props repeatedly.

Example:

```jsx
const Child = ({data, onChange}) => {
    return <div>{data.name}</div>;
};

const MemoizedChild = React.memo(Child);

const Parent = () => {
    const data = {id: '1', name: 'React'};
    const onChange = () => {
        console.log('Change triggered');
    };

    return <MemoizedChild data={data} onChange={onChange}/>;
};
```

In this case, `Child` will only re-render if either `data` or `onChange` changes. Using `React.memo`, we ensure that the
`Child` component doesn't re-render unnecessarily.

### Pitfalls with `React.memo`

- **Non-primitive values**: If the props passed to a memoized component are non-primitive (e.g., objects, arrays, or
  functions), React will compare references, not values. This can break the optimization if the reference changes on
  every render.
- **Spreading props**: Avoid passing non-memoized props, especially when spreading props between components.

### Example of Memoization with `React.memo`

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
    const data = useMemo(() => ({id: '1', name: 'React'}), []);
    const onChange = useCallback(() => {
        console.log('Changed!');
    }, []);

    return <MemoizedChild data={data} onChange={onChange}/>;
};
```

By using `useMemo` for `data` and `useCallback` for `onChange`, we ensure that both the `data` object and the `onChange`
function retain their references between re-renders, preventing unnecessary re-renders of `MemoizedChild`.

---

## Advanced Best Practices

### Rule 1: Avoid Prop Spreading

Avoid spreading props unless absolutely necessary. Instead, pass props explicitly to the component.

```jsx
// Incorrect - prop spreading can break memoization
<Component {...props} />

// Correct - pass props explicitly
<Component data={props.data} onChange={props.onChange}/>
```

### Rule 2: Avoid Non-Primitive Props

Ensure that any non-primitive props (objects, arrays, functions) are memoized. Passing non-memoized objects can break
memoization.

### Rule 3: Handle Props from Custom Hooks Carefully

Custom hooks often return functions or objects. If these are passed directly to memoized components, ensure they are
stable and memoized.

```jsx
const useForm = () => {
    const submit = useCallback(() => {
        // form submission logic
    }, []);
    return {submit};
};

const Component = () => {
    const {submit} = useForm();
    return <ChildMemo onSubmit={submit}/>;
};
```

### Rule 4: Avoid Frequent Re-Creation of Inline Functions

Inline functions create a new reference on each render, which can trigger re-renders unnecessarily. Use `useCallback` to
memoize these functions.

## Conclusion

Memoization is a vital tool for optimizing performance in React applications. By using `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and
`React.memo`, developers can significantly reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve the responsiveness of their
applications. However, it's essential to understand when and how to use these tools effectively to avoid breaking
memoization.

Keep these advanced best practices in mind for more robust and optimized React applications.

# React.memo and Children

Let's take a look at this code:

```jsx
const ChildMemo = React.memo(Child);
const Component = () => {
    return (
        <ChildMemo>
            <div>Some text here</div>
        </ChildMemo>
    );
};
```

Seems innocent enough: a memoized component with no props, rendering a
div inside, right? Well, memoization is broken here, and the `React.memo` wrapper is completely useless.

### What's Going Wrong?

This is because elements and children are just syntax sugar for the `children` prop. From the perspective of React's
reconciliation algorithm, JSX elements are equivalent to `React.createElement` calls. For example, the JSX:

```jsx
<ChildMemo>
    <div>Some text here</div>
</ChildMemo>
```

Is essentially:

```jsx
<ChildMemo children={<div>Some text here</div>}/>
```

Thus, even though `ChildMemo` is wrapped in `React.memo`, its `children` prop is not memoized. The div is a new object
on each render, which causes `ChildMemo` to re-render unnecessarily.

### Fixing the Problem

To fix this, we need to memoize the child element itself:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const content = useMemo(
        () => <div>Some text here</div>,
        []
    );
    return <ChildMemo>{content}</ChildMemo>;
};
```

Now, `content` is memoized, and React can correctly determine that no re-render is necessary for `ChildMemo`.

### Advanced Tip: Wrapping with `React.memo` and Render Props

The same issue arises when children are passed as a render prop. This approach is common when working with functions as
children, but these functions are often re-created on each render, breaking memoization.

For example:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    return (
        <ChildMemo>{() => <div>Some text here</div>}</ChildMemo>
    );
}
```

Here, the function is re-created with each render, so `React.memo` will not help prevent unnecessary re-renders. To fix
this, you can either memoize the function:

```javascript
const Component = () => {
    const content = useMemo(
        () => () => <div>Some text here</div>,
        []
    );
    return <ChildMemo>{content}</ChildMemo>;
};
```

Or use `useCallback` if the function doesn't need to recompute its return value:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const content = useCallback(
        () => <div>Some text here</div>,
        []
    );
    return <ChildMemo>{content}</ChildMemo>;
};
```

### React.memo and Memoized Children

Consider the following example, where both `ChildMemo` and `ParentMemo` are memoized:

```jsx
const ChildMemo = React.memo(Child);
const ParentMemo = React.memo(Parent);
const Component = () => {
    return (
        <ParentMemo>
            <ChildMemo/>
        </ParentMemo>
    );
}
```

At first glance, this may seem fine, since both components are memoized. However, `ParentMemo`'s children (the
`ChildMemo`) are not memoized. This can result in unnecessary re-renders of `ParentMemo` when the child changes.

### What's Happening Under the Hood?

In React, JSX is transpiled to `React.createElement`, which returns an object. When we pass a memoized component (
`<ChildMemo />`), the object is not memoized by itself, and React treats it as a non-memoized object, thus causing
`ParentMemo` to re-render.

To fix this, we can use `useMemo` to memoize the child element:

```js
const Component = () => {
    const child = useMemo(() => <ChildMemo/>, []);
    return <ParentMemo>{child}</ParentMemo>;
};
```

Alternatively, if `ChildMemo` is not necessary for preventing unnecessary re-renders of `ParentMemo`, we can simplify it
to a normal `Child` component:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const child = useMemo(() => <Child/>, []);
    return <ParentMemo>{child}</ParentMemo>;
};
```

### useMemo and Expensive Calculations

`useMemo` is often used to optimize expensive calculations, but this is a common misconception. What is an "expensive
calculation"? Is sorting an array of 300 items expensive? Is it more expensive than concatenating strings? How do we
know?

#### The Problem with "Expensive Calculations"

"Expensive calculations" are often subjective and can only be accurately measured in context. For example:

- Sorting an array of 300 items on a laptop may take less than 2ms, but on an old phone, it could take significantly
  longer.
- A regular expression that takes 100ms feels slow, but running it on an infrequent button click might not matter.
- If a calculation takes less than 10ms, but it's run in every render cycle (e.g., on mouse move), it could result in
  performance issues.

Always **measure first**. React optimizations should be based on actual performance data, not assumptions.

#### React's Rendering vs. JavaScript Calculations

Even in cases where the calculation is slow, rendering React components can often be the larger bottleneck. For
instance, sorting an array of 300 items may take less than 2ms, but rendering each element could take more than 20ms.
It's crucial to focus on reducing unnecessary renders before optimizing minor calculations with `useMemo`.

#### Measuring Performance

A key takeaway here is that we should **measure re-rendering times** in addition to the time it takes for individual
calculations. If memoizing an expensive calculation gives you a 10ms improvement, but re-renders still take hundreds of
milliseconds, then the memoization isn't making a noticeable difference.

Additionally, be aware that `useMemo` does not do anything on the first render. It only prevents unnecessary
recalculations on subsequent renders, which means it only becomes useful after the initial render.

### Best Practices and Key Takeaways

- **Don't overuse memoization**: Memoizing every function or component in your app can add unnecessary complexity
  without much performance gain. Use it sparingly and only after profiling.

- **Measure performance first**: Ensure you are actually improving performance by measuring the impact of changes. React
  re-renders and memoized calculations need to be evaluated in context.

- **Memoize props carefully**: Avoid passing non-primitive props (like objects, arrays, or functions) to memoized
  components without first memoizing them. React compares props by reference, not by value, and passing a new object
  every render can break memoization.

- **`React.memo` and children**: Remember that "children" is a non-primitive prop and should be memoized if it's
  dynamic (like an array, object, or function).

- **`useMemo` and `useCallback`**:
    - `useMemo` should be used when the calculation is expensive, not simply to avoid recalculations.
    - `useCallback` is useful for memoizing functions that are passed as props, but avoid using it unnecessarily.

### Final Thoughts

Memoization can be an effective tool for optimization in React, but it comes with many caveats and complexities. Itâ€™s
important to profile your application, understand the trade-offs, and ensure youâ€™re focusing on the most impactful
performance bottlenecks.

In conclusion:

- **Measure performance first**.
- **Memoize only when necessary**.
- **React.memo is powerful, but it should be used judiciously** to avoid excessive complexity and ensure that
  performance improvements are real.

Remember, `React.memo` is not a silver bullet for all performance issuesâ€”focus on improving overall component structure
and reducing unnecessary renders.
