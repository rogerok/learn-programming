# Optimizing React Rerenders

## Understanding React's Default Behavior

In React, when a state update is triggered, **all nested components re-render**, even if their props haven't changed.
Conversely, if a state update is not triggered, then changing props alone will not cause a re-render.

Let's analyze a common scenario where unnecessary re-renders occur.

### Example: Unnecessary Re-renders

```javascript
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
return (
    <div className="layout">
        <Button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open dialog</Button>
        {isOpen && <ModalDialog onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}/>}
        <VerySlowComponent/>
        <BunchOfStuff/>
        <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
    </div>
);
```

#### The Problem:

- The `isOpen` state is only relevant to the `Button` and `ModalDialog` components.
- However, the **entire parent component re-renders**, including `VerySlowComponent`, `BunchOfStuff`, and
  `OtherStuffAlsoComplicated`, even though they don’t depend on `isOpen`.

## Solution: Extract State-Dependent Components

To optimize performance, extract the state-dependent components into a separate component:

```javascript
const ButtonWithModalDialog = () => {
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
    return (
        <>
            <Button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open dialog</Button>
            {isOpen && <ModalDialog onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}/>}
        </>
    );
};
```

Then, use it inside the main `App` component:

```javascript
const App = () => {
    return (
        <div className="layout">
            <ButtonWithModalDialog/>
            <VerySlowComponent/>
            <BunchOfStuff/>
            <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Benefits:

- Only `ButtonWithModalDialog` re-renders when `isOpen` changes.
- The rest of the app remains unaffected, improving performance.

## Elements, Children as Props, and Re-renders

### The Problem

Imagine a large, performance-sensitive app with a scrollable content area:

```javascript
const App = () => {
    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block">
            <VerySlowComponent/>
            <BunchOfStuff/>
            <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
        </div>
    );
};
```

Now, you need to implement a floating block that appears when the user scrolls down and moves up as scrolling continues.
The simplest solution would be to attach an `onScroll` handler:

```javascript
const MainScrollableArea = () => {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState(300);
    const onScroll = (e) => {
        const calculated = getPosition(e.target.scrollTop);
        setPosition(calculated);
    };
    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block" onScroll={onScroll}>
            <MovingBlock position={position}/>
            <VerySlowComponent/>
            <BunchOfStuff/>
            <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### The Problem:

- **Every scroll event triggers a state update**, causing a re-render of **all nested components**.
- This results in laggy and unresponsive scrolling.

## Solution: Extract the Scroll State

Instead of handling state in the same component that renders slow components, extract it into a separate one:

```javascript
const ScrollableWithMovingBlock = () => {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState(300);
    const onScroll = (e) => {
        const calculated = getPosition(e.target.scrollTop);
        setPosition(calculated);
    };
    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block" onScroll={onScroll}>
            <MovingBlock position={position}/>
        </div>
    );
};
```

Now, pass slow components as children:

```javascript
const App = () => {
    return (
        <ScrollableWithMovingBlock>
            <VerySlowComponent/>
            <BunchOfStuff/>
            <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
        </ScrollableWithMovingBlock>
    );
};
```

Modify `ScrollableWithMovingBlock` to accept children:

```javascript
const ScrollableWithMovingBlock = ({children}) => {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState(300);
    const onScroll = (e) => {
        const calculated = getPosition(e.target.scrollTop);
        setPosition(calculated);
    };
    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block" onScroll={onScroll}>
            <MovingBlock position={position}/>
            {children}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Why This Works:

- **Only `ScrollableWithMovingBlock` re-renders on scroll events.**
- **Slow components are passed as props and do not re-render.**
- **React does not go "up" the component tree during re-renders.**

## Conclusion

- **State updates always trigger re-renders in the component that owns them.**
- **Extract state-dependent components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.**
- **Use props (children) to separate slow components from stateful ones.**
- **Understanding how React handles elements, components, and reconciliation can help optimize performance.**

By structuring components properly, you can avoid unnecessary re-renders and significantly improve React performance.

# React Components and Rendering

## What is a Component?

A **Component** is simply a function that returns **Elements**, which React then converts into **DOM elements** and
sends to the browser to be rendered on the screen.

### Example of a Simple Component:

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
    return <Child/>;
};
```

This function returns `<Child />`, which is an **Element** of a `Child` Component. Every time we use those brackets on a
component, we create an Element. The Element of the `Parent` component would be:

```jsx
<Parent/>
```

### Props in Components:

Props are just the first argument of the function:

```jsx
const Parent = (props) => {
    return <Child/>;
};
```

## Understanding Elements

An **Element** is simply an object that defines a component that needs to be rendered on the screen. The HTML-like
syntax is just **syntax sugar** for the `React.createElement` function.

Example:

```jsx
React.createElement(Child, null, null);
```

The object definition for `<Child />` would look something like this:

```js
{
    type: Child,
        props
:
    {
    }
,
    // if Child had props
...
    // lots of other internal React stuff
}
```

This tells React that `Parent` wants to render `Child` with no props.

### Rendering Normal DOM Elements

Elements are not limited to components; they can also be standard DOM elements:

```jsx
const Child = () => {
    return <h1>Some title</h1>;
};
```

The corresponding object definition:

```json
{
  type: "h1",
  ...
  // props and internal React stuff
}
```

## Re-Rendering and the Fiber Tree

What we usually call **re-rendering** is React executing component functions and updating the **Virtual DOM (Fiber Tree)
**.

1. React maintains **two trees**: before and after the re-render.
2. It **compares (diffs)** them to determine changes.
3. This is known as the **Reconciliation Algorithm**.
4. If an element **before and after re-render is exactly the same**, React skips re-rendering.

### How React Decides to Re-Render

React uses `Object.is` for comparison:

```js
Object.is(ElementBeforeRerender, ElementAfterRerender);
```

- If `true` → React skips re-rendering.
- If `false` → React re-renders the component.
- If **type** changes → React **removes the old component** and **mounts the new one**.

## Example: State and Re-Rendering

Let's add **state** to the `Parent` component:

```jsx
const Parent = (props) => {
    const [state, setState] = useState();
    return <Child/>;
};
```

- When `setState` is called, React **re-renders** `Parent`.
- `Parent` returns a new `<Child />` element.
- Since `Child` is **created inside** `Parent`, it is **re-created** on every re-render.
- The comparison `Object.is` **fails**, so `Child` **re-renders** as well.

## Optimization: Passing Elements as Props

If `Child` is passed as a **prop**, React can **skip re-rendering**:

```jsx
const Parent = ({child}) => {
    const [state, setState] = useState();
    return child;
};

// Rendering Parent
<Parent child={<Child/>}/>;
```

- The `<Child />` element is **created outside** the `Parent` function.
- When `Parent` re-renders, `child` remains **the same reference**.
- `Object.is(before, after) === true`, so React **skips re-rendering** `Child`.

## Real-World Example: Scrollable Component Optimization

```jsx
const ScrollableWithMovingBlock = ({content}) => {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState(300);

    const onScroll = () => { /* scroll logic */
    };

    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block" onScroll={onScroll}>
            <MovingBlock position={position}/>
            {content}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Why This Works:

- `content` is **passed as a prop**, so it remains **the same reference**.
- React **skips re-rendering** slow components inside `content`.
- `MovingBlock` **does re-render** because it is **created inside** the function.

This technique is **crucial for performance optimization** in React applications.

# React Components: Children as Props and Performance Optimization

## Understanding Children as Props

While passing elements as props is a valid and useful pattern, it can sometimes feel unnatural. Instead of passing an
entire page's content into a prop, we can leverage React’s **children** prop for a cleaner approach.

### Props Are Just Objects

Props are simply an object passed as the first argument to a component function. We can rename our `child` prop to
`children`, and nothing will change:

#### Before:

```jsx
const Parent = ({child}) => {
    return child;
};
```

#### After:

```jsx
const Parent = ({children}) => {
    return children;
};
```

### Special JSX Syntax for Children

JSX provides a special syntax for `children`. Instead of explicitly passing the `children` prop, we can **nest
components**:

#### Before:

```jsx
<Parent child={<Child/>}/>
```

#### After (Preferred Approach):

```jsx
<Parent>
    <Child/>
</Parent>
```

These two approaches are equivalent:

```jsx
<Parent children={<Child/>}/>  // Explicit
<Parent> <Child/> </Parent>    // JSX Nesting
```

### Internal Representation of Children

React represents the component and its `children` like this:

```javascript
{
    type: Parent,
        props
:
    {
        children: {
            type: Child,
        ...
        }
    }
}
```

Using `children` offers **the same performance benefits** as passing elements as props! Elements passed through props *
*do not re-render** if the parent’s state changes.

## Refactoring a Slow App for Better Readability

Consider an app with many slow components:

#### Before:

```jsx
const App = () => {
    const slowComponents = (
        <>
            <VerySlowComponent/>
            <BunchOfStuff/>
            <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
        </>
    );

    return (
        <ScrollableWithMovingBlock content={slowComponents}/>
    );
};
```

We can improve readability by using `children`:

#### After:

```jsx
const App = () => {
    return (
        <ScrollableWithMovingBlock>
            <VerySlowComponent/>
            <BunchOfStuff/>
            <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated/>
        </ScrollableWithMovingBlock>
    );
};
```

## Updating `ScrollableWithMovingBlock`

To support the new syntax, simply rename `content` to `children`.

#### Before:

```jsx
const ScrollableWithMovingBlock = ({content}) => {
    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block">
            {content}
        </div>
    );
};
```

#### After:

```jsx
const ScrollableWithMovingBlock = ({children}) => {
    return (
        <div className="scrollable-block">
            {children}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### The Result: A More Performant and Readable App

With this small composition trick, we’ve created a highly performant scrollable block while keeping our app clean and
easy to understand!
