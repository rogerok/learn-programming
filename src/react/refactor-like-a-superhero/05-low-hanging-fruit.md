## Code Linting

### Code linting

Good idea is to work on each linter rule as a separate commit or PR.
For example. we could remove all unused code, make it commit, and move on to the next problem on the list.

If the linter shows many errors, we can turn the rules one by one rather than all simultaneously
The smaller the steps, the easier it is to break the problem into several and solve each separately.
After fixing each rule, we’ll need to check if the tests pass. In the future, I will stop emphasizing test-checking to shorten the text. Let’s keep in mind that we check the tests after each change.
