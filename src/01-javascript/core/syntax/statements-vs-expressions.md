## Expression

**Expression** - is any valid unit of code that _resolves_ to a value.

Below `5` is expression, it resolves to value `5`

```ts
const x = 5;
```

Below `getAnswer()` - a function call - is another expression.This call will return a value, i.e. this function call will resolve to a value:

```ts
const y = getAnswer();
```

## Statements

Statement is an instruction, an action. For example `if`, `while`, `for`
All those are statements, because they perform actions and control actions, but don't become values
